<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The increasing popularity of Croquet,
and the deficiencies of the existing
manuals of the game, have encouraged
me to give this little book to
the public. The treatise of Captain Mayne
Reid, to which the introduction of croquet in
this country is mainly due, is deficient in
system and arrangement, and affords no intelligible
determination to many of the cases I
have instanced in illustration of the rules of
the game. The manuals published in this
country are still more faulty. The rules afford
no solution to half of the ambiguous cases that
arise in ordinary play; and some are guilty of
the strange error of allowing the "Roquet
Croquet" to every ball&mdash;a liberty totally at
variance with the fundamental principles of the
game, and which in the hands of strong players
would prolong the contest indefinitely, make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
victory depend upon a single chance hit, and
reduce the opportunities for generalship and
combination to a minimum. I have dwelt at
some length upon the "right of declining,"
and the "theory of double points;" principles
which, though hinted at by Captain Reid, are
left rather obscure in his book. Players will
find that this power of economizing privileges
adds greatly to the interest of the game, and
renders many a cunning plot and counter-plot
necessary.</p>

<p>The origin of this game is unknown. No
man invented whist or chess, and croquet like
them seems to have been evolved by some process
of nature, as a crystal forms or a flower
grows&mdash;perfect, in accordance with eternal laws.
There is in all these games a certain theory
which furnishes interpretations for all cases
that arise in actual play. The rules are grouped
about a central principle. The mimic battles
have a unity, and are homogeneous in all their
parts. If the rules are indefinite or contradictory
the game loses its distinctive character.
If the rules are accurate and rigidly enforced,
croquet is a game of the highest interest. I
am informed by a scientific billiard player that
though croquet is inferior to billiards in afford<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>ing
opportunities for delicate manipulation and
manual dexterity, that it far excels that elegant
game in the field it opens for the exercise
of the higher qualities of combination and
foresight. Whist exercises the memory and
the power of calculating probabilities; chess
the imagination and the faculty of abstract
reasoning; but croquet, though it taxes these
mental qualities less, combines them with the
delights of out-door exercise and social enjoyment,
fresh air and friendship&mdash;two things
which are of all others most effective in promoting
happiness. Those who have been in
the habit of regarding croquet as a game for
children may, perhaps, smile at my enthusiasm;
but let them procure a perfect ground, balls
and mallets, play half a dozen four-ball games
in strict accordance with the rules, and when
they can claim to have mastered the game,
they will acknowledge themselves converts.</p>

<p>I have adopted the plan of giving first definitions,
then rules, then cases adjudged under
the rules; as the common law consists of the
definitions of legal terms, the statement of legal
maxims or principles, and the reports of litigated
causes. The laws are in substance those
adopted by the "Newport Croquet Club," and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
many of the cases given actually occurred in
play, and were settled in full bench after long
and animated discussion. I think the laws will
not conflict with those of Captain Reid, while I
hope that they will be found more full and
accurate, and of more exact application. I
cannot flatter myself that I have provided for
every possible ambiguous case; still, I hope
that I have indicated the solution to most of
the questions that are likely to arise in the
course of a game.</p>

<p>I shall be very happy to receive suggestions
from any lovers of the game who may discover
errors or imperfections; for why should not
croquet as well as chess have its literature.</p>

another blow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Position.</span>&mdash;A ball is in position when it is in
front of its proper bridge, with a reasonable
probability of running it on the next blow.
The position is good or bad according to the
ease or difficulty of the run.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Proper Bridge.</span>&mdash;The next "step on the
round," the making of which constitutes a
point.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Push.</span>&mdash;Shoving the ball with the mallet, allowed
on some croquet-grounds instead of a
blow.</p>

the same blow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roquet.</span>&mdash;The contact of the playing ball
with another ball under such circumstances as
to constitute a point; that is, provided both

before in the same tour since the right to re-roquet
has been acquired.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roquet-Croquet; Croquet sans pied.</span>&mdash;The
privilege of the rover. It differs from croquet

foot, so that when struck it follows the croquetted
ball or diverges in another direction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rover.</span>&mdash;A ball that has made the grand
round, but not struck out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Running a Bridge.</span>&mdash;Passing through the
proper bridge from the front, or completing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
such passage, one of the steps on the round, a
"point," if made by a blow of the mallet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Side.</span>&mdash;One of the two parties of players, of
which the members play alternately.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spot.</span>&mdash;A point between the starting stake
and the first bridge, one mallet's length from
the former; from which the play commences.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Starting Stake.</span>&mdash;That near which the play
commences, and the striking of which by a
rover puts it out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Step on the Round.</span>&mdash;Running the proper
bridge, or tolling the stake at the proper time,
which advances a ball on the grand round, and
gives the right to re-roquet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Striking for First Choice.</span>&mdash;The usual method
of deciding the first choice, in making up the
sides and the first play. Each chief places a
ball under the arch of the first bridge and plays
at the stake. The ball lying nearest the stake
entitles the chief playing it to the first choice of
friends and the option of the first or second play.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Striking Out.</span>&mdash;Hitting the starting stake
when a rover, putting a ball out, and if the last
of the side constituting the victory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tolling the Stake.</span>&mdash;Hitting the turning
stake at the proper time; one of the steps on
the grand round.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tour of Play.</span>&mdash;The tour of a player or right
to play, following the order of the colors on the
stake, and continuing as long as he makes a
point.</p>

<h4>THE GROUND AND CROQUETERIE</h4>


<p>The most important requisite for a
croquet ground is smoothness of surface.
Very good sport may be had
on a ground slightly inclined; indeed
a little practice will enable the players to make
allowance for the inclination, so as to play with
as much accuracy as if the surface were horizontal.
But if the turf presents small inequalities,
the direction and force of the stroke can
never be accurately estimated. If the stroke
is gentle, the ball may fall short or be turned
aside. If the stroke is forcible, the ball will
bound along the ground, and may jump
entirely over another ball which it was intended
to roquet. A croquet ground can always be
brought to the requisite degree of smoothness
by having the surface beaten with a spade after
a rain; or, better still, thoroughly rammed
with a paver's mallet. Rolling is not so effec<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>tive,
unless the ground is very soft or the roller
very heavy. The size and shape of the ground
is a matter of much less importance. The
boundaries within which a ball can be placed
should be traced or agreed upon; still better
permanently defined by a ditch or slight embankment;
and should, if possible, form a
parallelogram of eighty feet by fifty. The turf
within them should be kept as short as possible.
The best arrangement of bridges for the four-ball
game is that given in Figure I. For the
six or eight-ball game Figure II. is preferable.
A ball meets with two kinds of obstructions in
making the "grand round"&mdash;it is obliged to
pass through all the bridges, and again it may
be croquetted and driven out of its course by
an enemy. In the six or eight ball game, the
dangers being much increased, it is well to
diminish the difficulties, or the contest may be
tediously protracted. This is accomplished by
removing the central bridge and straightening
the course. The channel is less tortuous, but
"roving" privateers, clothed with "belligerent
rights," are more frequently met, and the risks
and excitement of the passage are equalized in
both cases.</p>

<span class="smcap">No. II. Eight Ball Arrangement.</span>
</div>


<p>In the diagrams the dotted lines indicate the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
order in which the bridges are to be run, and
show the course of a ball making the "grand
round."</p>

<p>The balls should be perfect spheres, about
three inches in diameter, the size depending
upon the weight of the wood from which they
are made. Maple or beech is a very good
material, but the best are made from the
buttonwood or American sycamore. They
should be boiled in linseed oil to give them
the requisite weight and firmness. If boiled
too long, however, they will become too heavy.
Six ounces is about the proper weight, and a
light ball is infinitely preferable to a heavy one
for accurate play at long distances. Eight
balls constitute a full set. They must be
painted different colors, as the individuality of
each ball is an important element in the game.
As there is no necessity for the exercise of
great strength in croquet, a set of balls made
from seasoned wood and prepared as I have
described ought to last a generation.</p>

<p>A variety of mallets should be provided, as
different players prefer different sizes. One of
the surest hitters I have ever known uses a
mallet about fourteen inches long with a heavy
head. The wood of the apple tree is the best<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
material for the heads, and straight-grained
ash for the handles. The standard handle is
thirty-two inches long, one inch in diameter at
the upper end, and five-eighths of an inch at the
lower, tapering gradually. The head should
be a cylinder about two inches in diameter and
four inches long. It is best to make the faces
square; for if they are convex, it renders it
necessary to strike the ball exactly with the
centre of the mallet head to insure an accurate
stroke.</p>

<p>The stakes should be about two feet long,
and one and one-half inches in diameter. At
least one of them should have rings painted on
it corresponding to the colors of the balls.
This is merely to aid in recollecting the order
of play.</p>

<p>Nine bridges are required in the four-ball
arrangement, ten in the other. Firkin hoops,
or hickory withs, about as large as the ramrod
of a rifle, will answer the purpose very well.
If soaked a day or two they can easily be bent
into the required shape. The best, however,
are made of three-eighths round iron. The
span of the bridges should be rather less than
three times the diameter of a ball. Eight
inches is enough. If the ground is small so as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
to necessitate placing the bridges closer than in
the standard arrangement, the span should be
narrowed, and "vice versa," on the principle
that too much difficulty protracts the game, too
little renders it devoid of interest. The height
and form of the arch is immaterial, but the
pier or side of the bridge should be straight
for at least three inches from the ground, and
the centre of the arch from seven to nine inches
high. The bridges should be driven firmly into
the ground, in a plane perpendicular to the
horizon and to the line joining the stakes. An
inspection of the diagrams will furnish all
needful information as to position.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h4>MANNER OF PLAYING THE GAME</h4>


<p>The game of croquet may be played
by any number of players up to
eight. If eight enter the game, each
player must be provided with a mallet,
and each will play one ball. If a less
number of persons play, eight balls may still
be used, one or more of the players playing
two balls. In all cases there should be two
sides, or parties, each of course having the
same number of balls; and the balls, whether
played by the same or different persons, having
their turns always in the same prescribed order.
An eight-ball or even a six-ball game is apt to
be tedious, and skilful players invariably give
the preference to the four-ball game, which
may therefore be considered croquet <i>par
eminence</i>. With more than four balls the
element of chance enters too largely, and the
combinations become too intricate, to be foreseen
with any degree of certainty. The true<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
lover of croquet will no more be tempted into
an eight-ball game than a scientific chess-player
will indulge in that abnormal monstrosity
"four-handed chess." Played with
two balls only, the game degenerates into a
mere race. The four-ball game with two
players is preferred by many, though lacking
the sociality which is one of the charms of
croquet. As the rules are the same in all cases,
I shall hereafter, for convenience of illustration,
take it for granted that there are four balls and
four players. If the sides are not otherwise
made up, two of the players are selected as
chiefs. They strike for the first choice, (see
definition); the one who wins it chooses a
friend, then the other, and so on till the sides
are made up. The winning chief plays first if
he chooses, or, if not, the other chief leads,
and the winning chief plays second; then one
of the friends of the first player, and so on,
the members of the two sides playing alternately.
The first player uses the ball the color
of which is highest on the stake, and the next
takes the color immediately below. It is usual
to have the rings on the stake alternately some
light and dark color, so that the light colors
form one side and the dark the other. After<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
leading, the function of the chief ceases, except
in match games, when he is allowed to direct
the play of his side. At the commencement
of the game the first player places his ball
upon the spot, and strikes it with his mallet in
the direction of the first bridge. If it run the
bridge&mdash;that is, pass completely through it, he
has the right to another blow; if not it is
called a booby, and he must wait till the others
have played and his turn comes round again.
Suppose, however, that he has run the first
bridge, and on his second blow runs the second
bridge, he thus takes another step on the
"grand round," or makes another point, which
entitles him to still another blow. As it is
generally impossible to run the third bridge on
the third blow, he now tries to get "position" for
his ball in front of the third bridge; but as he
does not make a point on this last blow, he is
not entitled to continuance of tour. He therefore
stops, and the first player of the other side
begins by placing his ball upon the spot and
attempting to run the first bridge. If he runs
it he has a little more latitude in his play, for
he may now make a point in two ways&mdash;either
by hitting the other ball, provided it is not a
booby, or running his next bridge. Suppose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
he chooses to play for the second bridge, and,
having run it, plays at the other ball already in
position for the third bridge. If he succeeds
in hitting it, he is said to have roqueted it, and
having thus made a point, may play again and
attempt the third bridge. But he has still
another privilege; he may take his ball up,
place it by the side of the other ball, and
croquet it; after which he proceeds to play his
ball from the position in which he placed it,
having retained it there by his foot during the
croquet. He will probably be in position for
the third bridge. If he runs it his tour still
continues, and he may play for the next bridge,
or roquet the other ball again, which he may
previously have croqueted, into the proper
position. His tour continues till he fails to
make a point, when the next player on the
other side begins. After running the first
bridge, he acquires, of course, the right of
roqueting the other two balls. If he roquets
an enemy's ball, he croquets it, if he wishes, into
a disadvantageous position. If he roquets a
friend, he croquets his ball into better position,
or perhaps through its proper bridge. This
will constitute a step on the grand round for
the friend's ball, and will advance it as much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
as if it were driven through the bridge by the
mallet of its proper player. After roqueting a
ball, however, a player cannot roquet the same
ball again until his own ball has made a step
on the grand round. He may drive his own
ball against it, and perhaps displace it by the
concussion; but the hit does not constitute a
roquet, does not entitle to croquet, or to continuance
of tour. After making a step on the
grand round, however, all his privileges are
revived. After all the players have had their
tours in the order of the colors on the stake,
the first player takes his second tour, and so
on. At the beginning of each new tour the
grand round is taken up again, and the ball
may make a point by making the "proper step
on the round"&mdash;that is, the one next in order
to that last made&mdash;whether made by a stroke
of the mallet, by "concussion," or by croquet.
Or it may make a point by roqueting any of the
other balls. In the last case it may play again,
either from the spot to which it has rolled or
from the side of the roqueted ball; or it may
croquet it and then play, attempting the proper
step on the round, or roqueting another ball.
If it has roqueted all the balls, it can make a
point only by running its bridge, or tolling the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
stake, whichever may be the proper step; after
which, as said before, all its privileges are
renewed.</p>

<p>Thus the game continues until one of the
balls completes the grand round, as explained
in the diagrams. The last step is running the
first bridge in the reverse direction. The
player making this takes up his ball, unless he
has been so unfortunate as to strike out on the
same blow; and places it on the spot whence
he continues his tour as a rover, namely, that
of croqueting without the foot, or roquet-croqueting
after making a roquet. By this
means he not only drives off the roqueted ball
but follows it with his own, or forces them in
divergent directions. If he is skillful, he may
leave his own ball near one of the other balls,
which he may then proceed to roquet, and succeeding
in this, to croquet, or to roquet-croquet,
whichever may be most advantageous. As he
has no bridges to run he can never re-roquet,
and hence after he has roqueted and croqueted
all the other balls his tour terminates at the
next blow.</p>

<p>As soon as a rover touches the starting stake
it becomes a dead ball and must be removed
from the field. It makes no difference whether<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
it strike out by its own act, or is struck out by
its partner, or by one of the enemy. The
latter catastrophe will be of frequent occurrence
unless perpetually guarded against, for
the partner or partners are thereby left to fight
against superior numbers. When all the balls
of a side succeed in striking the stake the game
is over, and the side has won the victory.</p>

<p>With this brief outline of the game, the
reader is referred for details to the chapter on
the rules.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h4>THE RULES</h4>


<p>1. <i>Each ball must first be placed upon the
spot and played from thence.</i></p>

<p>A booby does not return to the
spot, but continues to play as a
booby, without the right to roquet or be
roquetted until it is bridged. Hence a booby
has but one blow unless that blow bridge it.
It may hit another ball and be hit, but the contact
never constitutes a point.</p>

<p>2. <i>The mallet must be used with one hand, and
the stroke must be a blow.</i></p>

<p>With balls and mallets of the standard size,
there is no necessity for using both hands. It
is difficult to draw the precise line between a
legitimate blow and a push. In every blow the
mallet follows the ball a little, for it takes a
small interval of time for the momentum of the
mallet to transfer itself to the ball; but in the
push a new impulse is given to the ball every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
instant, and this may act unfairly; for instance,
a ball is to be roqueted at a distance of six
inches or a foot. If the playing ball is pushed
until it reach the other ball, the latter is virtually
moved by the mallet as much as in the
roquet-croquet, instead of being moved by concussion
merely. This would be inconsistent
with the theory of the game. Again, a ball is
in contact with the pier of its proper bridge so
that it cannot run it by a blow. If a push be
allowed, it might be pushed into position, and
then pushed through by slightly changing the
direction of the mallet. It would thus be
played in a curved line. It may be objected to
this rule that the vicinity of the stake or the
piers of a bridge may render a blow impossible;
but a little attention will obviate the necessity
of playing in constrained positions.</p>

<p>3. <i>The stroke is delivered when an audible
sound is made or the ball moved.</i></p>

<p>The habit of giving the ball a little preparatory
tap should be avoided. It is allowed to
strike the pier of a bridge or the stake with the
view of moving the ball by concussion; but if
the ball do not move the blow is complete, and
the error in judgment cannot be rectified.</p>

<p>4. <i>The tour of a ball continues as long as it
makes a point, and terminates with the first blow
on which no point is made.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>5. <i>To make a point a ball must either make
a step on the grand round or roquet another
ball.</i></p>

<p>Croquet is not considered a point, because it
is not a play of the player's own ball but a
privilege, after which the tour is continued by
virtue of the roquet.</p>

<p>6. <i>Each ball before striking out must make
every step on the grand round in the prescribed
order, either directly by a blow of the mallet, or
indirectly by concussion or croquet.</i></p>

<p>"Directly by a blow of the mallet"&mdash;that is,
during the ball's own tour, whether proceeding
from the mallet immediately, or by rebound
from a fixed object or the person of an enemy.
"Indirectly," not during its own tour, when
moved by another ball or accidentally.</p>

<p>7. <i>Making the proper step on the round, but no
other, constitutes a point, or entitles to continuance
of tour.</i></p>

<p>A step made indirectly is no point either for
the playing ball or the other, though the latter
is advanced on its round.</p>

<p>8. <i>The bridges must be run from the front&mdash;that
is, from the side towards the starting stake for
the first half-round, and from the other side for
the second half-round.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>9. <i>A bridge is not run unless the ball pass completely
through it.</i></p>

<p>To decide this in a doubtful case, place the
mallet handle against the piers in front; if any
part of the ball project beyond the plane of the
bridge it will become evident. The ball is then
said to rest under the arch of the bridge.</p>

<p>10. <i>A ball resting under the arch of a bridge
and having come from the front makes no point,
but is in position to run the bridge.</i></p>

<p>The run may now be completed by concussion,
or, if the ball remain till next tour, by a
blow of the mallet.</p>

<p>11. <i>A ball resting under the arch of a bridge,
and having come from the reverse side, is not in
position to run it.</i></p>

<p>To decide a doubtful case, place the mallet
handle against the piers on the reverse side.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case.</span>&mdash;A ball was in position under the arch
of a bridge but is driven back, and afterwards
gains the same position from the reverse side.
Is it in position, since it once reached that point
from the front? No. The run of the bridge
must be continuous, though not necessarily at
one blow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>12. <i>If a ball pass completely through a bridge
and rebound or roll back, the run remains
good.</i></p>

<p>13. <i>If a ball pass completely through a bridge
in the reverse direction, and rebound or roll back
under the arch, it is in position.</i></p>

<p>14. <i>If a bridge be oblique any player may
adjust it, unless a ball be under the arch.</i></p>

<p>That is, it must first be decided whether the
ball has run the bridge or is in position.</p>

<p>15. <i>The stake may be tolled from any direction
and by the slightest perceptible touch.</i></p>

<p>An audible sound will be evidence of the
tolling; but when it is so near that the sound
cannot be distinguished from that of the mallet,
it must be seen to change its direction.</p>

<p>16. <i>A ball roquets another when it comes in
contact with it from a blow of the mallet; provided
both balls are bridged at the time of contact, and
the playing ball has not roqueted the other ball
before during the same tour since making a step
on the round.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case.</span>&mdash;A booby hits a booby and both pass
through the first bridge; can it croquet? No.
It is not a roquet unless they remain in contact
after passing through the bridge. It must
roquet again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>17. <i>A ball already in contact with another ball
does not roquet unless it move it perceptibly.</i></p>

<p>To do this it must, of course, play in a direction
less than ninety degrees from a line joining
the centres of the balls.</p>

<p>18. <i>A ball can acquire the right to re-roquet&mdash;that
is, to roquet the same ball again during the
same tour&mdash;only by making a step on the round.</i></p>

<p>A ball may hit another ball twice or more
during the same tour, and between two consecutive
bridges, or between the bridge and the
turning stake, and move it, each time by concussion;
but only one (not necessarily the
first) contact is a valid roquet.</p>

<p>19. <i>A roquet, but no hit which does not fulfil
all the conditions of a roquet, constitutes a point,
and entitles to continuance of tour.</i></p>

<p>20. <i>A roquet, but no other hit, entitles to the
privileges of croquet.</i></p>

<p>21. <i>The croquet may be declined, and the tour
continued from the spot to which the player's
ball has rolled, or from the side of the roqueted
ball.</i></p>

<p>The privilege of the croquet thus consists of
two parts. First, the option between the final
position of the playing ball and a new position
in contact with the roqueted ball, and on any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
side of it. Second, the croquet proper. The
second only, or both parts of this privilege may
be declined; but this must be distinguished
from "declining roquet" afterward mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case.</span>&mdash;A ball not a rover having roqueted
another ball, is placed in contact with it, and,
without using the foot, the player drives them
both in any direction, as in roquet-croquet. Is
this allowed? Yes. The croquet was declined
and the stroke was a common blow; but the
other ball, being merely moved by concussion,
(since it was previously roqueted,) the tour cannot
be continued unless a point was made at
the same time.</p>

<p>22. <i>If after a roquet the playing ball be taken
up or moved from its place, it must continue its
tour from the side of the roqueted ball.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case.</span>&mdash;A ball roquets another ball, driving
the latter by concussion through the playing
ball's proper bridge; remaining, however, in
position to run the bridge. The player begins
to move the ball, but on second thought concludes
to run the bridge. Can he claim to have
moved it by accident? No, even if it was not
taken up from the ground; for it may be presumed
that it was done with the intention to
croquet. Whether he croquet or not he must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
take position by the side of the other, and has
lost his opportunity to run the bridge. So, too,
if he takes position under the arch of the
bridge he is not in position to run it, for the
space over which the ball is carried is no part
of its course.</p>

<p>23. <i>The croquet must be executed before continuance
of tour.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case.</span>&mdash;A ball roquets another and on the
same blow runs its bridge; the croquet is then
executed. Does the run hold good. Yes, at
the player's option. <span class="smcap">Case</span>.&mdash;Under the same
circumstances the playing ball is taken to the
side of the roqueted ball. Can it re-roquet it
on the ground that it has run a bridge since
the roquet? No. The right to re-roquet must
be acquired <i>after</i> croqueting or moving the
playing ball. But the playing ball might have
re-roqueted from its final position, declining
the first croquet.</p>

<p>24. <i>The croquet is completed when the mallet
makes a perceptible blow against the croqueting
ball; but if the mallet altogether miss it, the blow
may be repeated.</i></p>

<p>The blow is perceptible if an audible sound
is made, whether the croqueted ball move or
not.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case.</span>&mdash;A player in croqueting claims to have
hit his foot; the croqueted ball, however, has
moved from its place. Can he restore it and
repeat the blow? No. The claim should not
be allowed, for it is impossible to tell in such
cases whether the ball was hit or only the foot.
If it be necessary to get the other ball out of
the way, he must drive it by concussion with
his own.</p>

<p>25. <i>If the player's ball flinch in executing the
croquet he forfeits the remainder of his tour, and
no point made by a flinching ball is valid.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case.</span>&mdash;A flinching ball rests under the arch
of its proper bridge, having come from the
front. Is it in position? No. If the complete
run is illegal, the partial run is also, as in the
case of moving a ball to croquet.</p>

<p>26. <i>If a ball be driven out of the arena, it must
be brought within it, and placed one foot from the
boundary at the nearest point.</i></p>

<p>This rule is on the supposition that the arena
is of the standard dimensions or something
near it. If from the imperfections of the
ground the boundaries at any place approach
too near the stakes or bridges, this rule must
be modified so that a ball shall not materially
alter its position with reference to the bridges,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
stakes, or other balls. Under the same limitations
it may be removed one foot from a tree
or other obstacle. The ball should be placed
immediately.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case.</span>&mdash;A's ball is played against a tree. If
B roquet it he cannot croquet it, or play his
ball afterwards to advantage. Can he compel
A to place his ball? Yes; but not so that B's
position after the roquet shall be improved. If
this were not so ruled, an obstacle would often
be made a refuge. Cases of this kind often
arise on imperfect grounds. They must be
settled like cases in equity; as fairly as possible
for each side, and so that neither can take
advantage of technicalities.</p>

<p>27. <i>If a player misplay, and the enemy challenge
him before allowing the play of another ball,
they have the option of replacing the misplaying
ball and any which may have been moved in their
former positions, or allowing any or all of them
to remain in the positions to which they have
rolled. And no point made by a misplaying ball,
if properly challenged, is valid, except at their
option.</i></p>

<p>The option belongs to the enemy of the
players and not of the ball. If the challenge
be made as soon as possible, though another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
ball is played at the same time, the requirements
of the rule are satisfied.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case.</span>&mdash;A misplaying ball runs a bridge after
croqueting its partner through his proper
bridge. The enemy challenge and elect to
leave both balls in their final position. Can
they compel them to renew their bridges? The
ball of the misplayer must re-run its bridge;
but any other ball has made the step unless it
is restored to its former position. The latter
is regarded as accidentally displaced, and
follows the rule provided for that case. If
the misplay consist of illegal continuance of
tour, of course the penalty does not extend to
the correct play which preceded it.</p>

<p>28. <i>If a player misplay, whether with his own
or another ball, he forfeits his next tour.</i></p>

<p>When a misplay is detected the play is
stopped, and the damages under the preceding
rules taken, and the player who should have
played takes his tour, and so on, omitting the
misplayer's next tour. Thus if A play in his
partner C's tour, the order will be C, D, B, C,
etc. If A play without right to continuance
of tour, the order will be B, C, D,
B, C, etc.</p>

<p>29. <i>If a misplay is not challenged until the play
of another ball has commenced, the play stands, but
the misplayer loses his first tour after the discovery.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case.</span>&mdash;D plays after A and is challenged,
but shows that A misplayed in his partner's
tour. Has D misplayed? No. He played in
his proper tour. C has lost his tour through
neglect, and A has anticipated a tour, while the
other side has lost the right to exact the penalty
for A's misplay, the order of play is B, A, D,
B, C, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case.</span>&mdash;While B is playing it is discovered
that A misplayed. Is B's play correct? Yes.
B naturally plays after A. B finishes his play,
and the order of play is B, A, B, C, D, B, etc.
Here A's tour is merely transposed, and B gains
an extra tour, so that in both cases the misplaying
side loses one tour. If a player
misplays in the tour of an enemy and is not
challenged in time, the misplayer and the
neglectful party will each lose a tour. Thus
if D omit his tour the order will be C, A, B, C,
D, B, etc. If A play without right to continuance
of tour, so as in effect to take two tours,
and it is discovered after B begins to play, A
merely anticipates his next turn, and the order
is A, A, B, C, D, B, etc.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>30. <i>If a misplay has taken place so that the
balls are playing in a wrong order, but the original
misplayer cannot be discovered, the playing ball
must finish its tour and the right order be taken
up.</i></p>

<p>A case of frequent occurrence in the four-ball
game. The sides are still playing alternately,
but in an inverted order, A, D, C, B.
A misplay has evidently been made, but none
of the subsequent players can be convicted,
because each has followed his partner after the
proper interval; hence no penalty can be
exacted on either side. If two partners are
playing in succession, the last always misplays;
and, if detected before the next play, must
suffer the full penalty, and any previous player
in the same circumstances loses his next turn.</p>

<p>31. <i>If a ball be played before the preceding ball
has finished or abandoned its tour, the enemy have
the option of replacing the ball to take its tour after
the other has finished, or letting the play stand as
the player's next tour.</i></p>

<p>This case is excluded from the definition of
misplay, and the penalty exacted is less. As
will be seen by the next rule, the ball prematurely
played will have had but one blow. If
it was a good one the enemy will have the ball<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
replaced; if a poor one they will let it stand;
and if an easy point has been made, the player
loses the rest of his tour, as in misplay, except
that if a step on the round is made it is valid.</p>

<p>32. <i>A player abandons his tour if he allows the
next player to make two blows before challenging
him, or make use of words or actions implying
that he has finished his tour.</i></p>

<p>As calling the name of a player or color of
the ball. Of course it is implied that a tour
abandoned cannot be resumed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case.</span>&mdash;A seems to abandon his tour, B begins
to play, and C reminds A of his right to continuance
of tour. Has A abandoned his tour?
Yes, if he had not intended to play until he
was reminded, or acted so as to convey such an
impression.</p>

<p>33. <i>A ball accidentally displaced may be replaced,
or allowed to remain, at the option of the
enemy of the player who caused the accident.</i></p>

<p>A ball moved under the foot in croqueting,
but not flinching, is accidentally displaced.</p>

<p>34. <i>If a ball accidentally displaced make a step
on the round, the step is valid unless the ball be
replaced.</i></p>

<p>In the same case the position is good if it
pass under the arch of a bridge from the front.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>35. <i>If a ball in motion be interrupted by one of
the players, it may rest at the point of interruption,
or be carried to the most distant part of the arena
in the direction in which it was moving, at the
option of the enemy of the player causing the
interruption.</i></p>

<p>If a croqueted ball is interrupted, the croquet
may be repeated.</p>

<p>36. <i>A player may decline any point made by
himself, and play precisely as if the point had not
been made.</i></p>

<p>Of course if no other point is made on the
same blow the tour is finished. The application
of the principle is connected with double
points. If a single roquet is declined, the
effect is the same as if the croquet and continuance
of tour were declined; but if a step on
the round is declined, it remains the proper
step and must be made again, and the tour
ceases. If the player wishes to adopt this
course he must signify that he declines the run
or toll, or he will be presumed to have declined
continuance of tour merely. Striking out is
not a point, and of course cannot be declined.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case.</span>&mdash;A ball passes through its bridge and
recoils under the arch. Can the player decline
the run, leaving the ball in position? No. If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
it ran the bridge, it passes under the arch in
the wrong direction in recoiling. So also if the
bridge declined is the second of two consecutive
ones run, or a single blow&mdash;a case more
likely to occur, as continuance of tour is then
retained by virtue of the first run.</p>

<p>37. <i>If a player decline one of two points made
on the same blow, he may continue his tour by
virtue of the other.</i></p>

<p>He should signify which one he intends to
decline; and unless he does so, either by words
or by the course of play, he may be presumed
not to have declined either.</p>

<p>38. <i>A step on the round made and declined
must be made again, and when made constitutes a
point.</i></p>

<p>For instance, a ball makes roquet upon
another ball, and accidentally glances through
its own bridge. If it should be in position
after croqueting, it may prefer to decline the
run and make it again. It must be remembered
that it is not in position if placed under the
arch to croquet, and that the roquet must have
been legitimate at the time of contact, otherwise
the run is the only point made, for the
right to re-roquet cannot be antedated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case.</span>&mdash;A ball makes roquet and runs a bridge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
at the same shot. After croqueting, he attempts
to run the bridge and fails. Can he adopt the
previous run? No. The attempt to run the
bridge shows that he elected to decline the
bridge. If he wishes to play in the direction
of the bridge without declining he should
signify his election, and then an accidental run
will not constitute a point. If he plays in
another direction, the bridge is not declined
unless he so signify. He has the option at the
time, but must make his choice at once; and if
he says nothing before he plays, he is committed
to that alternative which his play seems
naturally to indicate.</p>

<p>39. <i>A step on the round made by a ball through
concussion, croquet, or roquet-croquet from another
ball, cannot be declined, and the next step becomes
proper.</i></p>

<p>40. <i>A step on the round made by flinch, accident,
or misplay, is valid or not at the option of
the enemy of the party in fault, who must make
their decision at once.</i></p>

<p>In case of accident or displace through a
misplaying ball, it depends upon whether the
ball is left or replaced. In case of the misplayer's
ball, or a flinching ball, the option is
with the enemy. In the cases of Rule 39 there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
is no option, and in Rule 36 it rests with the
player himself.</p>

<p>41. <i>If a ball makes two successive steps on the
round with one blow of the mallet, and does not
decline the latter, it may take ground up to a
standard mallet's length before continuing its tour.</i></p>

<p>The first step cannot be declined from the
nature of the case; the second may, but then
there is no ground for the premium. The
second point will be declined if it is possible to
make very good position for the second bridge
by roquet, or to glance off from the stake to
advantage. If the mallet's length allows a ball
to take ground on the reverse side of its proper
bridge this will not count as a run, nor will the
ball be in position if placed under the arch.
Up to a mallet's length of course includes
everything less.</p>

<p>42. <i>A step on the round is not declined if it be
made the ground for continuance of tour, re-roquet,
or taking ground under the last two rules,
and in such case it cannot be made again.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case.</span>&mdash;A having already roqueted B's ball,
can he decline the run? If he does the hit is
no roquet, and no point has been made.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case.</span>&mdash;A runs a bridge and roquets a ball.
The two balls rest in such relative positions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
that A can roquet the same ball back through
the bridge. Can he, after doing this, re-run
the bridge? Not on that tour; for if he continues
his tour, the second hit must have been
a roquet; the roquet on the first blow must
have been declined; therefore the bridge could
not have been declined. Or, if the bridge was
declined, the first hit was a roquet and the
second no point; therefore his tour is at an
end.</p>

<p>43. <i>A roquet made and declined may be made
again during the same tour, although the right to
re-roquet has not been acquired, and when so made
it constitutes a point.</i></p>

<p>The first hit was not a roquet if really
declined. (See Rule 45.) A ball may be hit
and moved by concussion before a roquet as
well as after one. Thus if a step on the round
and a roquet be made on the same blow, the
player may at once croquet the roqueted ball,
or roquet it again immediately or after other
roquets. Not croqueting the ball is evidence
enough of having declined, as there could
never be any advantage in declining the croquet
and not the roquet, if it can properly be
declined.</p>

<p>44. <i>A ball making ricochet&mdash;that is, roqueting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
several balls on the same blow&mdash;may croquet them
all in the order of the roquets.</i></p>

<p>Any one of the roquets may be declined and
made again after croqueting the other balls in
their proper order. Not croqueting is sufficient
evidence of declining; but if none are croqueted,
and the ball is not moved to the side of
any one, the player must declare which he
means to decline. As soon as a step on the
round is made, it no longer makes any difference
whether a roquet was declined or not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case.</span>&mdash;A ball makes roquet on two balls
simultaneously. Can it croquet them both?
Yes, and the player should have the option of
either order.</p>

<p>45. <i>A roquet is not declined if it is made the
ground for continuance of tour, croquet, or playing
from the side of the roqueted ball; and in such
case the same ball cannot be roqueted again during
the same tour until the right to re-roquet has been
acquired.</i></p>

<p>46. <i>A ball running the last bridge by a direct
blow of the mallet must be carried to the spot and
played from thence as a rover, unless it strike out
on the same blow.</i></p>

<p>The ball in this last case passes over the
spot, and thus of itself complies with the con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>dition
and becomes a rover, after which it may
strike out. Hence, also, if it does strike out, the
bridge cannot be declined so as to save the ball.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case.</span>&mdash;A ball runs the last bridge and roquets
a ball on the same blow. Can it croquet? Not
unless the bridge is declined, otherwise it must
be placed on the spot immediately.</p>

<p>47. <i>A ball running the last bridge otherwise
than by a direct blow of the mallet becomes a rover,
but must be played from its final position like any
other ball.</i></p>

<p>48. <i>A rover having no bridges to run can never
re-roquet.</i></p>

<p>A rover can make no more points than the
number of balls in the game, and can have but
one more blow.</p>

<p>49. <i>A rover, but no other ball, may roquet-croquet
a roqueted ball instead of croqueting it.</i></p>

<p>If the player, however, elect to use the foot,
and his ball flinch, he must suffer the penalty.
If in flinching the rover strike the starting
stake, he is out if the enemy so decide.</p>

<p>50. <i>If a rover in roquet-croqueting hit another
ball, it may accept or decline the roquet.</i></p>

<p>It is entitled to another blow after roquet-croquet
at any rate; therefore the roquet is not
necessary to give continuance of tour.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>51. <i>A rover fails to roquet-croquet if the other
ball is not moved, and the tour terminates unless
another ball is roqueted on the same blow.</i></p>

<p>The blow not being a roquet-croquet, a point
must be made to entitle to continuance of tour.
A roquet-croquet is precisely like a roquet
when the balls are in contact. (See Rule 17
and remarks.)</p>

<p>52. <i>A rover is struck out whenever it touches
the starting stake, except when in case of accident
or misplay the enemy of the party in fault decide
otherwise.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h4>HINTS TO BEGINNERS</h4>


<p>1. Leave your ball as far from your enemy
and as near your friend as possible.</p>

<p>2. If you are in advance, help your
friend; if you are behind, call upon
him to help you.</p>

<p>3. Recollect that position directly under the
arch of your proper bridge enables you to command
all the field in front of it. You can run
the bridge and leave your own ball near any
other you wish to croquet, as the run gives you
another shot. It is many times advantageous
to decline making any stroke from such position,
and wait until you see an opportunity to
do execution among the enemy.</p>

<p>4. Take pains and exercise judgment on
every stroke.</p>

<p>5. If you are a rover, leave yourself close to
your friend. He can then croquet you towards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
the enemy who played last, whom you can
afterwards demolish with impunity.</p>

<p>6. Play strictly according to rule; apply the
laws rigidly, but be liberal in settling disputed
questions of fact.</p>

<p>7. Do not attempt difficult shots except in
desperate circumstances.</p>

<p>8. If the enemy have a rover, make every
effort to put it out. One of you can then
watch the remaining enemy while the other
finishes the round. Your partner then relieves
the guard while you make your bridges. The
most desperate games can often be thus
redeemed.</p>

<p>9. Never despair because you are behind.
The game is never out till it is played out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>

<p class="center"><i>From the Boston Journal.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Abbott is always an entertaining writer for the young, and this
story seems to us to contain more that is really suggestive and instructive
than other of his recent productions. Florence and John are children who
pursue their studies at home, under the care of their mother, and in the
progress of the tale many useful hints are given in regard to home instruction.
The main educational idea which runs through all Mr.
Abbott's works, that of developing the capacities of children so as to
make them self-reliant, is conspicuous in this."</p>

<p class="center"><i>From the New York Observer.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Abbott is known to be a pure, successful and useful writer for the
young and old. He is also the most popular author of juvenile books
now living."</p>

<p class="center"><i>From the Boston Traveller.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>From the Boston Journal.</i></p>

<p>"While in general this story resembles Mr. Abbott's, it is superior to
some of that author's later works. It is marked by his best characteristics&mdash;the
easy, natural dialogue, wholesome, moral and religious tone,
and simple explanatory style, without being tiresome in repetition. It
describes home scenes and suggests home amusements."</p>

<p class="center"><i>From the Salem Register.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Trowbridge will find many welcomers to the field of authorship
as often as he chooses to enter it, and to leave as pleasant a record behind
him as the story of "Father Brighthope." The "Old Battle Ground" is
worthy of his reputation as one of the very best portrayers of New England

<p>"These charming volumes are the much admired Geldart Series of
books for the young, which have established a very enviable reputation
in England for their wholesome moral tendency. They are beautifully
printed 16mo volumes, with gilt backs, and are sold at 50 cents each.
There are five volumes in the series, and they will form a very choice addition
to a youth's library."</p>

<p class="center"><i>From the Worcester Palladium.</i></p>

<p>"What children read they often long retain; therefore it is desirable
that their books should be of a high moral tone. In this respect Mrs.
Geldart has few equals as an author, and we hope that her works will be
found in every child's library."</p>
